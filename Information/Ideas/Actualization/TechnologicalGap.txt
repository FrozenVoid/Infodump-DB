A technological gap time is 
period from idea emerging and
its actualization to a state 
of art object.
Example:
timekeeping device->clock-> atomic clock
the period from idea of timekeeping
 device to Atomic clock is the
 "Gap time" which gets shorter
 with level of technology rising.
 At singularity the gap between
 emergence of idea to its 
 ultimate form would be zero.
