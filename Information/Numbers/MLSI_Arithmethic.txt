MUlti-level Symmetric Index:
extend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_level-index_arithmetic
by adding to each level a quantity 
parameter(add/sub) to store operations
outside of top level value(that can use mul/div/etc).

The precision of lower levels in LI will
store float X(+/-) that will be the 
result of operations below top value in tack.
When a number is displayed it will show
t.xxx+t-1.xxx+t-2.xxx where xxx are altered
values from operations on that level.
