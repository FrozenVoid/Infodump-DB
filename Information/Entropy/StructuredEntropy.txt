At the level above random noise,
where entropy decreases, some structure emerges
this post-chaotic structure(SE:Structured Entropy)
is significant source of possible
inspiration: the human mind finds patterns 
in nearly-chaotic soup of SE to fill in gaps,
as abstract skeletons of SE patterns are reified
into imagined concrete structure(CS).
The above process could be automated to
seed fractal/generative algorithms which bring out
patterns out of seemingly random data,
tuning them into "harmonic/periodic" structures,
that are aesthethically appealing and more complex
that those which are designed with concrete
structure in mind(artists mental structure->
reificiation-> concrete structure->implementation)
as possibility space of random data exceeds
all mental space(due biological limits and 
inherent structures in the mind).

Current AI art generation is geared towards replication
of human mental space vectors, which are 
inherently limited regions of total possibility
space that exists in random data.
