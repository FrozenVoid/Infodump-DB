Harmony function would be companion to entropy
to determine the periodicity/symmetry in
 a data structure: 
 a completely chaotic dataset would be 
 high entropy and low harmony,
 but a low entropy dataset could have different
 values of harmonicity.
 
 In music lack of harmony in low-entropy data
 would equivalent to:
