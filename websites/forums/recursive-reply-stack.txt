a forum thread splits into sub-forums which are
titled with replies first line of text,
and instead of threaded reply stack,
reply chain become sub-forums, allowing growing discussion
recursively.
example 1:
thread A
reply1-> link to new subforum titled as reply-1 text.
reply2-> link to new subforum ..etc
withe reply to reply1 forming another subforum,etc.

Advantages->
1.can sort by density of sub-forum content, instead of score.
threads evolve into their own subforums if they're popular.
2.automatically created sub-categories/forums for new content.
forum structure becomes user-editable content.
