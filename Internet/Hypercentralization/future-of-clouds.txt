Current hyper-centralized "internet of clouds" is going
to end up with same fate as walled gardens of past(cf. AOL).
Economies of scale that power the clouds will eventually run out 
of steam, with smaller datacenters and local hosting getting the
same performance per watt(consider things like cryptocoin mining moving towards 
cheaper local electricity sources).

Some metrics that clouds excel at create anti-patterns

1.Single point of failure cascades:
system that are "too big to fail" are vulnerable 
to central system attacks(e.g. ISP block, censorship, DDoS).

2.Mandatory occupancy:If the cloud is mostly 
unused its waste of hardware and electricity to keep
it running.
A.Hardware turnover is slow, meaning clouds
are essentially running on old computer clusters(less efficient).

3.Overhead of network interaction:
distrubuted services create a cost vs integrated systems.
