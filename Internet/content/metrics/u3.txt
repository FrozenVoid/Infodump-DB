Easy metrics to gauge potential audience interest
unique - content is unique/novel(e.g. discovery)
useful - content presents useful information(facts/stats/graphs)
unusual - content is not in routine/normal/predictable form:
the last metric is about form of representation,
e.g. a meme is more unusual form of distributing content
vs a dry summary(similar to one-sentence posters vs long-form text)
which would create more interest and can be backed by quotes/citations/etc.
