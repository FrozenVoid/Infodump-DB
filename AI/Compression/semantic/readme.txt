AI could be used to create semantic compression( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_compression   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_simplification),
e.g. turning a 100 page book into 30page book by removing
superflous detail, irrelevant descriptions and
segments which have no influence on the rest of the book,
summarizing paragraphs with less detail without losing accuracy
and replacing complex constructs with smaller semantic equivalents.
