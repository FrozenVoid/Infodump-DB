quantum processors/co-processors can accelerate many
 neural network and arrays based algorithms:
GPUs and classic ASICs are inherently limited to parallelize
 code which still has to perform work equivalent of Multiple Threads,
whereas quantum algorithm reduces such computation to One-thread quantum  computations which are much lower in energy cost(single state encompassing multiple computation threads simultaneusly  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy ).
