there are no files, every category of files is a specific
database which containg files/tags/collections,
e.g. program database for loading programs,
picture database for storing pictures,etc
each with its own capabilities: a rogue program can't erase another program
because it doesn't have the capability to open the program database.
Sockets and non-file devices are just sockets and devices,
with their own capability/acl systems.
