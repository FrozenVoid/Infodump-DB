A SVG file will solve the following:
1.Multiple icon size: SVG icons will be scalable at any res.
2.Bloat: png/ico/x-icon are pixel based vs vectors.
3.Flexibility:SVG Vectors can be minified and optimized for performance/size.
Disadvantages:
Current svg rendering may be insecure or slow vs image formats.
