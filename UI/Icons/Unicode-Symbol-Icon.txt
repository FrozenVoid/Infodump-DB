a lightweight alternative for bloat-free systems;
Assign a single unicode codepoint as "Icon" of application;
Unicode contains a wide array of symbols, emoji and pictograms
that require only a few bytes to store.
(if program has no Icon a letter variant of its name's first letter
can used, e.g. two programs which start with F will get sequential
variants of F(or its homographic equivalent glyphs))
