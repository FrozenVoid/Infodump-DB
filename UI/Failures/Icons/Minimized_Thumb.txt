Minimized Thumb icon design is an icon
generated from periodic screenshot(!!!) of
of a program window, which create following 
problems:

1.Confusion: as icons on desktop or 
any dynamically managed window change 
due content changes.
2.Latency: each update of N icons has to 
take N screenshot thumbnails.
3.Privacy: leaking user state to UI parts.
(similar to "thumbnail databases" used for
images in folders).
