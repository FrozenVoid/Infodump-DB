Time can be represented with letters(A:cd)
which signify hour:minute
with minute being 0-9:0-9
and hour a single capital letter.

Advantage: more compact,less ambigious forms.
Time can be spoken as three-letters:
with minute letters set to use different
letters(e.g. qwertyuiopas,dfghjklzxc) with
position, e.g. A:qd means 0:00 and A:q=0:0x)
