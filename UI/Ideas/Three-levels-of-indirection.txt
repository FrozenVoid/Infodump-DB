Most content/functionality should be accessible within
3 levels of indirection; e.g. 3 clicks, 3 menu choices,etc.
What should go in:
1.Selection of category.
2.selection of sub-category or core function.
3.Normal functionality. 
4.Niche/rare functionality that is rarely used.
5.Advanced tweaking/settings that don't appear to be useful in average use-case. 
Protips:
User defined hotkeys can reference any useful functions to reduce indirection.
Group most important functionality earlier in the list.
Always Use scrollbars to avoid interface being partially invisible.
Allow command line parameters to set all options at start of program.
Always enable keyboard navigation of tab-panes/categories/submenus/popup elements.
