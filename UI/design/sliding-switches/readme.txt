sliding on/off switches are one of the worst UI elements.
There are completely unintuitive(unlike checkboxes and radio button switch).
A sliding switch ON and OFF states are not apparent from ui,
they can appear as opposite state, without any indication.
Usually they're combined with half-baked mobile interfaces that
also use 'slide' to switch between pages.
