SSDs are wearing out and
HDD platters spinning all day?
Modern browsers write and
read gigabytes of useless data
to the disk, store all 
'temporary data' and
cache content to disk.
Modern browsers contact dozens
of different servers in 
background that
are completely opaque to user
and serve the browser maker 
needs rather
than user interests.

Without disabling and configuring
dozens of settings, a modern
browser is a waste of disk,
network and CPU resources.
Most users do not change these
settings or are oblivious to 
background activity of their
browser.
