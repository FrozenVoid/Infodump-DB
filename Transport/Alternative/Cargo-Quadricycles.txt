Cargo Quadricycles.
Most people don't require the
massive energy-waste of a car
for transporting light loads,
but bicycles and two-wheel transport 
are often inadequate and
provide little safety/stability
in practice, leading to incidents.
 
Cargo Quadricycles(with or without
electric motor assistance) 
provide a light-weight, very
economical alternative to both
cars and bikes:
The design is a standard quadricycle
with increased length for cargo
space behind the seats.



vs Cars:
1.Equivalent or better cargo
capacity.
2.Much lower cost(even with motors)
3.Less complex maintaince
4.Equivalent riding comfort(
excluding weather resistance,
which depends on construction)

vs Bikes:
1.Inherent stability due four wheels.
2.Better capacity for cargo
3.Increased comfort
4.Increased safety(less impact
due 4wheel design)
5.Easier to learn vs two-wheel design.

vs Public Transport:
1.Less dependence on schedules
 and availability in all areas.
2.More ecological benefits:
pollution/noise/energy use decrease.
3.Less infrastructure/investment:
road maintaince, traffic complexity 
decreases(no bus stations, bus stops,
scheduling and dependence on local finances)
