A pipe with expanding conus(diameter)
at both ends have the following
advantages:
1.smooth transition boundary
vs linear pipe having a sharp,
abrasive boundary: deformation/deterioriation
of ends in pipe is very common.
Ends of such pipes can be 
reinforced separately.

2.Ability to mechanically link
 pipes of smaller diameter,
 by length of expanded conus
 section.

3.reduce abrasion due lack of
boundary(edge) at transition to
normal pipe diameter.
