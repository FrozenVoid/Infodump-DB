Many products with vastly different features
as opposed to cosmetics, often nudle inside
a "model range".
The problem with model-separation is consumer 
confusion leading to low exposure of different
product options, that if separated would be 
more popular.
Solution: segregation of feature sets into 
distinct products and
cosmetic variations into models/variants.

Why consumers can't do it:
the consumers are mostly non-technical and
judge products by appearance,price and name.
If a Product A with same appearance
has variant X and cheaper variant Y,
consumers would pick Y(as it looks the same,
name sounds the same, and price is cheaper)
overwhelmingly.
If the variants has distinct appeaprance
and names(as separate products) they would
be judged by their differences(e.g. Fruit prefix
 vs "fruit category") and mentally more
 complex image would form(products vs variants)
