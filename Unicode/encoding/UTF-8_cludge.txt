UTF-8 was designed to be backwards compatible
with ascii, this was in era where text file size was
significant.A proper 4byte encoding(like UTF-32, though without any 'reserved'/'unused' blocks) would resolve
all problems with UTF-8(and allow 4B glyphs), with compression taking care of most
size problems.
