new scehem fro Crypteria:
1.file->intX
2.generate random IntA of same size as intX,
3.A xor X=> B, store merged A+B as int Q of x2 size.
4.prepare a random Int Z of x4 size of Q.
5.spray bits of Q into Z, force-setting bits at positions determined
by usual crypteria random chain of places(gap 0-4).
6.run through reversible transforms to obfuscate output.
