Lockdowns work chiefly due this:
1.Reduced human gatherings reduce spread ratio(r-number),
removing viral vectors. Virus spread is proportional
to density of population, cities are known to be hotspots
since ancient times for any communicable disease.

2.Night curfew/lockdown prevents transmission 
during hours where Sun UV radiation is absent.
UV radiation kills viruses: especially direct sunlight.
At night people are unaware of personal inter-distance,
allowing droplets(cough/breathing) to spread easier(low lightning+no UV).

3.Lockdowns discourage non-local travel:
Isolation depends on virus staying-at-place and decaying with low R-number,
whereas traveling spreads new mutations and variants to distant
population centers, allowing access for a high genetic diversity(potential
easy vectors/mutations).
