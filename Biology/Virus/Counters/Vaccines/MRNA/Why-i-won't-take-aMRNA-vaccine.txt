mRNA vaccine is a new genetic insertion technology that is marketed
as a 'vaccine', but in reality being a RNA vector that subverts the cell genome
to produce viral proteins: something that would be an artificial virus.

mRNA vaccines are:
1.New, unproven technology, first mRNA vaccines ever.
1a. RNA is fragile and rapidly mutates.
2.Rushed into development. https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11
3.Lack long-term studies backing them.
4.Backed by laws granting total legal immunity to their producers.

Scientists actually admit its a viral vector meant to be a synthethic virus:
