A site catalogue for English neologisms describing complex emotional/mental states
that current language doesn't have a word for
(popular, dictionary words require mass audience that
expirience such emotions).
Ironically, conservative languages such as Japanese feel just
fine adding dozens of such obscure emotional terms every year,
probably due analytical appeal of describing these states reliably.
