If you have no artistic talent, AI has that covered.
Steps to create your own music:
1.Generate Seed Melody:
you will need 4 random blocks of data from:
https://qrng.anu.edu.au/random-block-alpha/
Copy these blocks to
2. Text melody generator:
http://kickthejetengine.com/langorhythm/
Click save MIDI, don't bother listening in its current quality.

3.Change primary instrument to something like 'vibraphone' or 'violin'
You can use a midi editor or some web tool to edit
the first track of result midi. Pick any instrument
that sounds better than default piano.
Note:Multiple random tracks(from #2) can be combined,
though autotuning the result will be harder.

4. Convert MIDI to .wav/.mp3 
Ensure you use best quality soundfonts.

5.Autotune:
Use autotune tool/app/website to harmonize the melody.
Additionally you can normalize volume/pitch/tempo 
to more palatable sound: some autotune tools
 only work good with vocals, try different.
 Note: If your preffered 'music genre' is something
  unpolished, experimental or noise-like don't autotune,
  the random QRNG output will be better(autotune
  sound synthethic).

5.Name the melody in format Band Name - Song Name:
You can have multiple 'Band' accounts to categorize
 resulting music. e.g. name generators
https://www.name-generator.org.uk/band-name/
https://randomnamegenerator.org/song-name-generator
If you prefer to give it a 'personal touch'
Generate artist name + avatar
Avatar: https://artflow.ai/ Upscale with bigjpg
Name: http://www.rinkworks.com/namegen/index.shtml


6.Cover picture for a song:
use https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/dalle-mini
with input from random 9-30 char strings 
from https://qrng.anu.edu.au/random-block-alpha/
pick the most colorful/complex pic
then upscale it x4 with 
https://bigjpg.com/ (optional: denoise)

7.Use a graphics editor to place band name &
 song title into the picture center(or if center is complex
  in some corner). Fancy fonts with graphics effects
  (3D, emboss, caleidoscope) with the letters will make
  it automatically professional looking.
  Use ornate/cursive font with bold, big letters for maximum effect.
  A name should not be covering more about 1/10 the height
 of image. 
  
 8.Combine the wave file & resulting "song picture"
 in a video editor. Upload the video to youtube or 
 some video sharing website of your choice.
 Don't upload multiple videos per day: let the site algo 
 think its unique,rare content uploaded infrequently.
 
 9.Optional; Use proxies/VPN and view your video
  each 1-2 hours from  different IPs - this boosts its ranking.
  If you have multiple accounts upvote/like the song:
  but place the upvotes/likes organically(random delay
  of 2-5 hours each from different IP/account).
  Promote the song if you like from anonymous/fake profiles
   on social media.
 
 10. You're now a music creator. If you're lucky
 some of the generated song will make it big:
 people liked the melody & organically upvoted it.
 Now you can add vocals:
 Use vocaloid/utau type software and generate lyrics
 from https://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/
 Autotune the result. Try different lyrics+music combos.
