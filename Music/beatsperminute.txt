BeatsPerMinute is actually effectively brainwave frequency,
by which songs with beats will recalibrate the brain.
Its a form of monaural waves, that use focused listening to
embed the beat in the brain(unless the person listens to a stronger 
binaural/monaural beat effect at same time).

Some quick facts:
Most BPM values fall between 60-180BPM,or 1-3hz,
which is Delta wave range:
this range is used for deep trance/meditation, NREM sleep and
hypnotic effects as brain is effectily put into 'Deep Sleep' state,
where conscious facilities are reduced or subdued in some form.
