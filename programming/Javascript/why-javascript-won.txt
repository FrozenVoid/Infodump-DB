Its still puzzling for some why a mediocre scripting language become
so powerful and influential.
Origins:
1.JavaScript central place in the web was created due
lack of competing <script> implementations in browsers:
<script> tags were not confined to JavaScript.
2.Ease of use: easy C-like syntax and dynamic typing were influential
at attracting new programmers. 
3.Low-bandwidth interactive content that can be examined and studied without any barriers:
 JavaScript animations, popups, interactive menus and simple games were instrumental
at carving up a niche. Unlike Flash, javaScript is inherently open-source content,
that allows new programmers to copy and learn the tricks/features of a webpage. 
Features of language:
1.Prototypes: there seems to be a hidden OOP gem that is rarely explored,
yet its model of adding 'prototype functions' is very natural to understand vs class inheritance(esp.multiple inheritance), allowing greater flexibility in design. 
2.JavaScript arrays: the js associative array design is extremely flexible,
with objects accessible as arrays e.g. obj['methodstring']() creating unique
 dynamic approaches to evaluation(e.g. obj[get_method(p)](get_param(e)) ==obj.method_name(param) )
without eval(), as well as Function() constructors;
3.Typed arrays; Typed arrays transformed javaScript to allow performance
 optimizations exclusive to native compilers.
4.syntax with complex operators simplifying code flow:
