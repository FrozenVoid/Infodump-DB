It seems Rust has more or less stabilized with
no major syntax changes or library drift.
 Rust was viewed as too unstable and buggy(based on their
issue tracker the compiler segfaults quite too often),
and borrow checker was extremely pedantic, but currently
they claim both have substantially improved.
Is it a valid competitor to C++? Time will tell.
