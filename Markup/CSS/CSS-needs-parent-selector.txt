at least for element blocking, i think the current CSS wizardry
required to emulate parent selectors 
is inefficient and could be replaced by simply extending CSS to refer to 
parentNode. CSS parent selector will be required for next stage in adblocking:
css stateless selectors > dynamic blocking, and ad providers 
are using dynamically generated div soup contexts where CSS blocking
fails to find a path to target element.
