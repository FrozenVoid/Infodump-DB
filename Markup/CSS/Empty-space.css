Setting width:900px or margin:30px is not scalable.
Besides it creating empty space, the design is only looking good
on specific resolutions, unlike vw/vh units.
It adds ugly empty space "gaps" which waste screen real estate.
Margins and padding are nasty hacks that hide bad positioning 
of actual nodes.
