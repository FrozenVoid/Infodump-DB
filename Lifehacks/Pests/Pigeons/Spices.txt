Pigeons dislike strong smelling spices,
cinnamon in particular.
Deterrent:
1.Get a plastic bottle.

2.mix cinnammon+curry+some
 dried herbs(basil/pepper/etc) or other sharp
 smelling spices

3.make ventilation hole in top of plastic bottle
so the smell goes upwards(but reduces rain flow inside)

4.put the spices in. The spices have antiseptic
properties and will not rot easily, so
cinnamon smell lasts longer.

5.secure the bottle with rope/wire
to pigeon nesting/landing location.
Wires ensure the spices stay in same position
and direction to provide area smell.

6.repeat with all places they land in.
