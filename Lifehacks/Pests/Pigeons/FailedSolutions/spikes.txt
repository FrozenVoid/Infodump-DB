Pigeons can bend spikes with time
and will learn to maneuver around them.
If you go overboard and turn it into fortifications
with nails and barbed wire, the pigeons
will die and rot in place(substantially worse
in terms of hygiene than letting them in).

1.Pigeons can fly around most spikes.
2.Pigeons seem to find  paths where spikes
are not effective.
