Nets against pigeons usually fail because
some gap or hole allows them access.
Pigeons can break weak plastic nets if they
are determined.
Only steel nets and total coverage of
 landing area helps.
If pigeons find a way, they will treat it
as secure space where they can nest safely.
If net bends inwards, pigeons will nest 
in the warped net piece[1].
Pigeon nets cannot be used with all locations
and securing them in high places will be risky:
furthermore strong wind will damage even steel nets
since they're secured in few places.

[1] Usually where net is horizontal and stable(
it has to be vertical or near-vertical everywhere)
