You have 
1. Sharp scissors or equally sharp instrument
2. a plastic bottle (with cleanin+g solution/liquid/etc)
3.lack of actual spray bottles(because e.g. you don't trust chemicals they use in such stuff)

make a hole in the bottle cap from the inside(crucial)
using scissors or some sharp instrument.
The outer side of bottle cap will bulge out with sharp ridge
which will direct the spray in straight line forward.
