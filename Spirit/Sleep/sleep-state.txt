Sleep is a possession state where 
shadow(etheric body layer or any spirit/demon controlling it) overtakes
the mind(mental body) in control of physical body,
Sleepwalking is when etheric body is under control of some external
attached entity(likely a demon) with the astral body not present but attached.
i.e Sleep as state of mind is analoguos to trance and possesion,
a reduced consciousness and mental focus - its not a neutral rest 
state...
