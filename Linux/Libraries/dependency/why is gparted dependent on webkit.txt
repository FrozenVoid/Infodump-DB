I've checked that mx-installer depends on gparted,
which uses yelp-based 'help system' and yelp
depends on webkit(to display html), which is to say,
Linux partition editor depends on Webkit.
A low-level tool that should have just a man/info page
and at most .html files, but chooses a specific format viewer
that require webkit libraries...
